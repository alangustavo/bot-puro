# Crypto Trading Bot for Binance

This project aims to develop a cryptocurrency trading bot for Binance, controlled via Telegram. The bot will leverage Clean Code principles, Test-Driven Development (TDD), DRY, and other best practices to ensure maintainability and reliability.

## Features

- **Market Data Streams**: The bot will subscribe to multiple Binance streams to receive real-time market data.
- **Trading Strategies**: Based on the market data, the bot will execute buy and sell strategies for a predefined list of cryptocurrencies.
- **Telegram Integration**:
  - Notify the user of trade actions (e.g., bought/sold).
  - Allow the user to interact with the bot to request information about the current operation (e.g., profit or loss status) and the results of all trades.
  - Enable the user to configure trading parameters such as stop-loss percentages, activate trailing stop, set minimum loss thresholds (to avoid frequent trades), and other attributes.

## Goals

- Automate cryptocurrency trading with customizable strategies.
- Provide real-time updates and interaction through Telegram.
- Ensure code quality and maintainability using Clean Code principles and TDD.
